The game is played on four grids, two for each player. 
The grids are  10×10 squares and the individual squares in the grid are identified by letter and number. (A-J along x axis and 1-10 along y axis)
On one grid the player arranges ships and records the shots by the opponent. 
On the other grid the player records his/her own shots.

Before play begins, each player secretly arranges their ships on their primary grid. 
Each ship occupies a number of consecutive squares on the grid, arranged either horizontally or vertically.
The number of squares for each ship is determined by the type of the ship. 
The ships cannot overlap (i.e., only one ship can occupy any given square in the grid). 
The types and sizes of ships are as follows:

Name				Size
--------------------------
Aircraft Carrier	5
Battleship			4
Submarine			3
Destroyer			3
Patrol Boat		2

After the ships have been positioned, the game proceeds in a series of rounds. 
In each round, each player takes a turn to attack a target square in the opponent's grid. 
If it is a "miss", the attacked player marks their primary grid with a white peg. 
If it is a "hit" they mark this on their own primary grid with a red peg. 
The attacking player notes the hit or miss on their enemy grid with the appropriate color peg (red for "hit", white for "miss"), in order to build up a picture of the opponent's fleet.

When all of the squares of a ship have been hit, the ship is sunk, and the player's hud draws a red X over the opponent's ship status icon.
If all of a player's ships have been sunk, the game is over and their opponent wins.
